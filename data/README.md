Here is all the input metadata and output data from from the *AMPtk pipeline* :

**1. 4_new_tax_.biom:** contains otu and taxonomy tables obtained with AMPtk and serves as input for initial R script (1_taxonomy.biom is the initial 
file before doing individual blast searches for assigning taxonomy and trophic mode, 3_new_tax_.biom is an obsolte version of this file, and 2_taxonomy.txt
is an editable version previous to converting back to .biom)

**2. amptk.mapping_file.csv:** contains sample data to be used as input for initial R script (same as amptk.mapping_file.txt) 

**3. metadata_soil_roots.xlsx:** contains soil sample nutrients data
